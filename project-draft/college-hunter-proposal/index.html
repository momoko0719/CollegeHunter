        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>The U.S. college application process is a complex and troublesome one. Applicants must consider various factors when selecting a college or university of their choice, such as major rankings, school environment, job opportunities, and standardized requirements.</p>
        <p>However, because different colleges have their own websites and use different application systems, this raises the following issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Applicants cannot view all the information they need in one college application interface.</li>
            <li>Institutions' requirements change from year to year, resulting in applicants receiving information that may be out of date.</li>
            <li>While there are many websites or rankings available to help applicants choose a school, many of these websites don't have the feature to allow users to save their target schools in a subset and organize information on their websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The existing websites, e.g., <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/" target="_blank">BigFuture</a>, can help applicants consolidate information about colleges and universities, but users do not have access to the specific information needed to apply. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Application timeline</li>
            <li>Application essay questions</li>
            <li>Application requirements (SAT, GPA, TOEFL, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What if there is a website that would help applicants get detailed information when applying to universities and the ability to provide the correct information about application timelines, materials, etc., directly from the university's official website?</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>High school senior students who are in college application season and looking to search college admission information and organize application documents will be main users for our website. The information users view will be provided by the dataset built by our team. But our team will cite data from confidential external sources like <a href="https://www.usnews.com/" target="_blank">U.S.News</a>, and each college’s own official website to make sure information on our website is professional, which means we will create the tables and columns of dataset by ourselves but data in our database will be drawn from confidential college application information sources. 
        </p>
        <p>There will be 3 features on our website. The first one is the college information search engine, which can be considered as a data exploration application. With the filter function in our search engine, users could pick out the colleges they want to apply to based on their preferences, such as locations, gpa and sat requirements, rankings, target majors and so on. The next feature is saving target schools to users’ own wish list, which means users could create subsets of data from large colleges list. With this function, users could add colleges they want to apply to during their information searching process, so that they could easily locate the admission information in their wish list. The last feature is an application material checklist for all the colleges the users add to their wish list, which could be considered as a data organization application. This one-page section will be organized in 4 parts:
        </p>
        <ul class="descriptionlist">
            <li>A list of college names the user want to apply that links to each school’s official website
            </li>
            <li>A timeline that exhibit each school’s application deadline
            </li>
            <li>A list of all the essay questions the users need to response and each question will be followed by the name of college needs that question
            </li>
            <li>A collection of required application materials like minimum gpa and sat requirement, if interview is optional or not, etc gathered based on all the schools the users want to apply
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these features on our websites, users could effectively search, save, and manage college applications materials during their application season.
